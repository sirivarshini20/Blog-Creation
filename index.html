                <p>Water is the basic necessity for the functioning of all life forms that exist on earth.
                     It is safe to say that water is the reason behind earth being the only planet to support life.
                     This universal solvent is one of the major resources we have on this planet.
                     It is impossible for life to function without water.
                     After all, it makes for almost 70% of the earth. </p>

                <a href="#" class="blog-title">Is animals are related to nature?</a>
                <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia.<br> With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move,<br>can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells,<br> the blastula, during embryonic development</p>
                <p>Why are animals important to life?<br>
                    Animals improve the welfare of humans in many ways, ranging from providing companionship, <br>improving mental health, facilitating rescues during natural disasters; and finally, for a number of species, as food.<br> Dogs used in therapy, and as aids for people with disabilities, provide important benefits.

                <p>This article is about all Flora.<br>
                    A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk.
                    This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. 
                    For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil.
                    Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development.</p>
